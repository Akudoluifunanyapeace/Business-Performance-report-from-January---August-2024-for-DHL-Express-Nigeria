## Project Overview
This Data Analysis project provides insight into the Business performance for a frictional data set of a branch in DHL Express Nigeria from January to August in the year 2024. By analyzing the monthly sales return, the number of waybills generated, the number of times a customer used their services and the number of times a shipment has been delivered to a city.

## Analysis and Visualization

I created a very simple and easy to understand visuals using DHL Express brand color (Yellow and red) to show different insights gotten from the data set. The color used for this visual can be understood by anyone, even those with color vision deficiency can acess it.

I created a number of visuals to show the monthly revenue summary, the month they had their peak sale and the month they generated the highest waybill

## Findings and Recommendation

### Base on this analysis I found out that 
-	The month with the highest waybill generated isn’t the same as the month with the highest sales. Which implies that generating much waybill for the month doesn’t equate to high income revenue.

-	80% of their top deliveries are within cities in Nigeria

 ### Base on the analysis I recommend the following actions
-	Since most of their deliveries are within Nigeria, especially Lagos they should recruit more Third-party agent / Courier guys to those cities to make delivery of waybill to the Consignee/ receiver more faster.
  
-	They should invest more in marketing and running Ads in the Month of January in order to increase sales.
-	
-	The months where they made little or no sale like January, they should cut down on unnecessary Expenses that could lead to losses.
   
-	To encourage their top 5 customers, they can reward them with end of the year Gift, slashing of delivery prices for them toward the end of the year and many other attractive offers that will make them keep coming back again to use their services. This can increase customer retention rate.
